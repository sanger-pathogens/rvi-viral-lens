    *                Subtype SCOV2 sequence

    The run_pangolin process in this Nextflow pipeline is designed to
    classify SARS-CoV-2 sequences into lineages using the Pangolin
    tool. Pangolin (Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak
    LINeages) is a tool widely used in the analysis of SARS-CoV-2
    genomes to determine the likely lineage of the virus based on the
    consensus sequence.

    Pangolin documentation:
    https://cov-lineages.org/resources/pangolin.html

    * ---------------------------------------------------------------
    * Input
        - `meta`: Metadata associated with the sample, including
            identifiers like sample ID and taxonomic ID.
        - `mapped_fasta`: The path to the consensus FASTA file
            generated for the sample.

    * Output
        - `mapped_fasta`: The path to the input consensus FASTA file.
        - `env(lineage)`: Environment variables capturing the lineage
            assignment information, which are extracted from the
            Pangolin output.

# Script Breakdown

1. **Run Pangolin**:

    - Command:
    ```
    pangolin "${consensus_fasta}" --outfile "${lineage_report}"`
    ```

    - This command runs Pangolin on the input consensus FASTA file
    and writes the results to a CSV file named with the sample ID
    and `_lineage.csv` suffix.

2. **Extract Lineage Information**:

    - The script uses the IFS (Internal Field Separator) command to
    parse the CSV output file from Pangolin, extracting values from
    each column into environment variables.

    - The script expects only one row of data (excluding the header)
    in the lineage report and reads this data into variables such
    as taxon, lineage, conflict, ambiguity_score, and others.

    - If for any reason the consensus fasta has more than one
    sequence, we would be able to get results for the first sequence
    only. At current implementation, this should never happen because
    ivar only outputs one consensus sequence per taxid sample
    combination. If this ever changes, we will need to adapt this
    process.

3. **Log Lineage Details**:

    - Lineage details such as taxon, lineage, and conflict are echoed
    to in order to be captured as strings on the output channel.

    - Curretly, only `$lineage` is used for downstream analysis.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

> TODO:
    -The `Taxon` and `Conflict` values are echoed in order to
have those value within easy access on the `.command.log` files, it
was usefull for debugging during development, but may be not necessary
to keep it anymore. We should remove it.
